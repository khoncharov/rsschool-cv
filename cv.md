## About myself

For 14 years I worked as a commercial vehicle design engeneer at JSC MAZ. My domain was active safety systems, electronic air suspension system and objective control systems. During my career I participated in application of ABS ESP EBS systems, developed requirements for objective control systems (like dashboard), developed software for collecting and analyzing data from vehicle on-board systems, developed software for prototyping future functionality. I gained experience in the development of complex products from technical specifications to production, testing and support.

Currently I'm studying on Front-end courses. For me frontend is an opportunity to change my profession and expand my capabilities as an engineer.
